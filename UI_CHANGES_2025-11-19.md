# UI Changes — 2025-11-19

Summary of applied UI updates:

- Progressive image loading: enabled native `loading="lazy"` and added a blur-up visual effect for images via `.progressive-img` styles in `app/static/main.css`. `core.js` initializes progressive behavior automatically.
- Print support: inserted a header `#print-btn` into main templates (`index.html`, `patient.html`, `doctor.html`, `admin.html`, `login.html`). `core.js` handles print flow and temporarily hides interactive elements during printing.
- Print CSS: added `@media print` rules and a `.printing` helper that hides headers, buttons, notifications, modals, and other interactive UI components for clean printed output.
- SEO: added Open Graph, Twitter card meta tags and a minimal JSON-LD snippet to main page templates to improve sharing and indexing.
- Device tester: added CSS for `#device-tester-overlay` to make the diagnostic overlay usable; the overlay is activated via `?dev=1` or Ctrl+Shift+D and includes copy-to-clipboard.

Next steps (recommended):

1. Convert selected large/dynamic image `src` to `data-src` placeholders in templates/JS and validate blur-up on real pages.
2. Run cross-browser manual tests (mobile/desktop) for print, loading, and device overlay.
3. Update user-facing docs with print instructions and SEO notes.

Files changed (high level):
- `app/static/main.css` — added progressive/device/print styles
- `app/static/core.js` — UI helpers were already added and initialized
- `app/templates/index.html`, `patient.html`, `doctor.html`, `admin.html`, `login.html` — added meta tags and `#print-btn`
